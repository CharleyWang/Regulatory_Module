# Introduction

This script is designed to identify regulatory modules (RMs). The approach was developed using RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum but should be applicable to many other eukaryotic genomes. Our method is built based on the Hidden Markov Model, and builds a generic framework that allows RMs search in other eukaryotic genomics.
